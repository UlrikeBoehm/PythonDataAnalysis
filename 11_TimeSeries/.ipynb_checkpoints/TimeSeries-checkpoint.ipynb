    "__Time series__ data is an important form of structured data in many different fields, such as finance, economics, ecology, neuroscience, and physics. Anything that is observed or measured at many points in time forms a time series. Many time series are _fixed frequency_, which is to say that data pints occur at regular intervals according to some rule, such as 15 seconds, every 5 minutes, or once per month. Time series can also be _irregular_ without a fixed unit of time or offset between the units. How you mark and refer to time series data depends on the application, and you may have one of the following:\n",
    "- _Timestamps_, specific instants in time\n",
    "- Fixed _periods_, such as the month January 2007 or the full year 2010\n",
    "- _Intervals_ of time, indicated by a start and end timestamp. Periods can be thought of as specialcase of intervals\n",
    "- Experiment or elapsed time; each timestamp is a measure of time relative to a particular start time (e.g., the diameter of a cookie baking each second since being placed in the oven)"
